Below is exactly what you need — **the correct fix + the reason + the command to apply it.**

---

# ✅ **Your Issue**

Kubernetes will throw this error:

```
error: unable to recognize "/root/deployment-definition-1.yaml": no matches for kind "deployment" in version "apps/v1"
```

This happens because:

### **❌ kind: deployment is wrong (lowercase d)**

### **✔ It must be: kind: Deployment**

Kubernetes resource kinds are **case-sensitive**.

---

# ✅ **Fixed deployment-definition-1.yaml**

Save this corrected YAML inside:

`/root/deployment-definition-1.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deployment-1
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: busybox-pod
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: busybox-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: busybox-container
        image: busybox
        command:
        - sh
        - "-c"
        - echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 3600
```

---

# ✅ **Now apply it**

Run:

```
kubectl apply -f /root/deployment-definition-1.yaml
```

Check Deployment:

```
kubectl get deployments
```

Check Pods:

```
kubectl get pods
```

---

# 🧠 **In simple terms: Why this fixed it?**

Kubernetes looks for resource types (Pods, Services, Deployments).
These names are **exact** and **capitalized**.

So:

### ❌ deployment

### ✔ Deployment

That is the only issue.
